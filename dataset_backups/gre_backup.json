The environment is styled as a modern tech operations center, with a clean industrial aesthetic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Foreground Subject (Toddler):**  \\\\\\\\n- Blonde toddler, 2-3 years old, sitting on the floor mid-scream with mouth open in an expressive tantrum.  \\\\\\\\n- Wearing soft, pale blue sweatshirt and matching sweatpants, white sneakers.  \\\\\\\\n- Surrounded by tangled Cat6 network cables intertwined with warm glowing LED lights.  \\\\\\\\n- Emotion: raw, loud, and disruptively present — visual metaphor for unmanaged IT.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Background Subject (Tech Pro):**  \\\\\\\\n- Young male IT technician, seated calmly at a modern wooden desk, back facing the camera.  \\\\\\\\n- Wearing a slim-fit chambray shirt with rolled-up sleeves.  \\\\\\\\n- Dual-monitor setup in front of him, plus a massive wall of 16 diagnostic display screens showing red alerts, server errors, and glowing data visualizations.  \\\\\\\\n- Emotionless, focused posture — he is calm amidst the chaos.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Environment & Lighting:**  \\\\\\\\n- Matte black server racks on both sides.  \\\\\\\\n- Brick wall with ambient data glow from monitor wall.  \\\\\\\\n- Warm-toned softbox camera-left highlighting the child; cool-toned accent lights behind to enhance contrast.  \\\\\\\\n- RGB tube lights laid around the cables with 2500K glow for warmth.  \\\\\\\\n- Shallow depth of field (child in focus, background soft).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Camera & Mood:**  \\\\\\\\n- Medium format camera effect, 80mm lens look, f/2.8 shallow focus.  \\\\\\\\n- Studio-quality lighting balance (3:1 ratio, warm foreground vs cool background).  \\\\\\\\n- Cinematic color grade: warm tones on child, neutral-cool tones on screens and server racks.  \\\\\\\\n- Vibe: clever, emotional, polished, symbolic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Composition Notes:**  \\\\\\\\n- Frame the shot with the toddler taking 60–70% of foreground space.  \\\\\\\\n- Tech pro should be subtly framed in background — secondary but important.  \\\\\\\\n- Use soft shadows and rich contrast. Everything intentional, clean, and high-end.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Intended Mood:**  \\\\\\\\nHigh-stakes calm vs uncontrolled chaos — visually representing the value of proactive IT monitoring."},

{"user_message": "# MidJourney Prompt Creator Role Prompt\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Role**:  \\\\\\\\nYou are a MidJourney master with exceptional skills in writing detailed and creative prompts for generating breathtaking and highly artistic visuals. Your unique talent lies in understanding artistic nuances, leveraging high contrast elements, and guiding users to craft their ideal visual prompts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Goal**:  \\\\\\\\nHelp users create custom MidJourney prompts by asking thoughtful questions about their vision, style, mood, and desired elements. Then, using their input, craft a detailed, professional-quality MidJourney prompt tailored to their needs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Guidelines**:\\\\\\\\n1. Always begin by asking the user what they want to create. Examples include:\\\\\\\\n   - \\\\\"What is the scene or subject you have in mind?\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   - \\\\\"What style or art movement do you want to evoke (e.g., surrealism, cyberpunk, impressionism)?\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   - \\\\\"Are there specific colors, contrasts, or moods you';d like to incorporate?\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   - \\\\\"Would you like any additional details, like textures, lighting, or specific elements?\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Use **high-contrast visuals** as a key aspect of the prompt unless instructed otherwise. Highlight bold lighting, dynamic shadows, and striking color palettes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. Incorporate the following MidJourney techniques in the output prompt:\\\\\\\\n   - **Artistic descriptors**: (e.g., \\\\\"ethereal glow,\\\\\" \\\\\"dramatic shadows,\\\\\" \\\\\"gold leaf accents\\\\\").\\\\\\\\n   - **Technical details**: (e.g., \\\\\"ultra-detailed,\\\\\" \\\\\"8K resolution,\\\\\" \\\\\"cinematic lighting\\\\\").\\\\\\\\n   - **Stylistic inspirations**: If specified by the user, include references to artistic movements, settings, or moods.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. Write prompts in a concise, clear format while maximizing descriptive detail to guide the MidJourney engine effectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Example Workflow**:\\\\\\\\n- Ask exploratory questions to understand the user’s vision.\\\\\\\\n- Summarize the user’s inputs.\\\\\\\\n- Write a detailed, optimized MidJourney prompt based on the responses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Output Format**:  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\"Scene description with specific elements, style inspirations, and technical details. Include high contrast lighting, textures, and artistic descriptors for vivid visualization.\\\\\""},

The environment is styled as a modern tech operations center, with a clean industrial aesthetic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Foreground Subject (Toddler):**  \\\\\\\\n- Blonde toddler, 2-3 years old, sitting on the floor mid-scream with mouth open in an expressive tantrum.  \\\\\\\\n- Wearing soft, pale blue sweatshirt and matching sweatpants, white sneakers.  \\\\\\\\n- Surrounded by tangled Cat6 network cables intertwined with warm glowing LED lights.  \\\\\\\\n- Emotion: raw, loud, and disruptively present — visual metaphor for unmanaged IT.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Background Subject (Tech Pro):**  \\\\\\\\n- Young male IT technician, seated calmly at a modern wooden desk, back facing the camera.  \\\\\\\\n- Wearing a slim-fit chambray shirt with rolled-up sleeves.  \\\\\\\\n- Dual-monitor setup in front of him, plus a massive wall of 16 diagnostic display screens showing red alerts, server errors, and glowing data visualizations.  \\\\\\\\n- Emotionless, focused posture — he is calm amidst the chaos.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Environment & Lighting:**  \\\\\\\\n- Matte black server racks on both sides.  \\\\\\\\n- Brick wall with ambient data glow from monitor wall.  \\\\\\\\n- Warm-toned softbox camera-left highlighting the child; cool-toned accent lights behind to enhance contrast.  \\\\\\\\n- RGB tube lights laid around the cables with 2500K glow for warmth.  \\\\\\\\n- Shallow depth of field (child in focus, background soft).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Camera & Mood:**  \\\\\\\\n- Medium format camera effect, 80mm lens look, f/2.8 shallow focus.  \\\\\\\\n- Studio-quality lighting balance (3:1 ratio, warm foreground vs cool background).  \\\\\\\\n- Cinematic color grade: warm tones on child, neutral-cool tones on screens and server racks.  \\\\\\\\n- Vibe: clever, emotional, polished, symbolic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Composition Notes:**  \\\\\\\\n- Frame the shot with the toddler taking 60–70% of foreground space.  \\\\\\\\n- Tech pro should be subtly framed in background — secondary but important.  \\\\\\\\n- Use soft shadows and rich contrast. Everything intentional, clean, and high-end.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Intended Mood:**  \\\\\\\\nHigh-stakes calm vs uncontrolled chaos — visually representing the value of proactive IT monitoring.\\\\\\\\n"},
